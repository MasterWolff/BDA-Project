    Updated remove_redundancies(df_name) 
        defined df_new as dropping the columns from the dataframe defined in the parameter "df_name". 
        The columns dropped are defined in the list redundant_columns.

    Updated remove_redundancies(df_name)
        Though it looked to be working in Klaus' iteration, the result of the function was not being correctly saved
        and calling upon 'df' later would just call on the imported version, not the processed one.

    Started removing index column <-- Work in Progress
        When using the pd.read_csv() function, a new column is created that cannot be called upon, this is the index column
        and is what I am trying to remove. Though it is not directly influencing our data or the way we wish to progress 
        with our machine learning, it is just quite cluttered to look at because we have so many rows. I've not yet figured
        out how to make it work correctly, I can remove the index column during import, but then the 'id' column takes its
        place and creates a whole new slew of problems. for now they are muted as they influence the other code, feel free
        to fix if you want, I will try to fix at a later date if not resolved by then.

    Started importing for ML + TTS
        Imported train test split (TTS) and performed this on the data, considering the target value to be the
        'stop_outcome' column, and the data to be the rest.
